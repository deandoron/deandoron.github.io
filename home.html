  <p class="col-text">I am a faculty member in the Institute for the Theory of Computing of the Faculty of Computer and Information Science at Ben-Gurion University.</p>

  <p class="col-text">My research lies within Theory of Computation, mainly computational complexity, randomness in computation and explicit combinatorial constructions.
    Especially, I am interested in pseudorandomness, derandomization, and error-correcting codes.</p>

<p class="col-text">Before coming to Ben-Gurion, I was a Motwani Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford and a postdoctoral researcher at UT Austin hosted by Dana Moshkovitz and David Zuckerman.
I received my PhD from Tel-Aviv University, where I was fortunate to have Amnon Ta-Shma as my advisor.</p>
